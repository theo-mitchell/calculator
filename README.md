# Calculator

### This is a simple calculator built using pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

<br>

### It is built to fullfiled specifications outlined by The Odin Project:

<br>

### There are a couple key improvements that could be made, but vast majority of the features suggested by The Odin Project have been implemented.

<br>

### While I do not expect there to be any demand, this project is published under MIT licence, as a matter of principle.
