### It is built to fulfill specifications outlined by The Odin Project:

### There are a couple key improvements that could be made, but vast majority of the features suggested by The Odin Project have been implemented.

#### While I do not expect there to be any demand, this project is published under MIT licence, as a matter of principle.
